# React + SASS + Vite to create Dashboard

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Pulled from this video to build this.  
- [Create a Custom Admin Dashboard UI with HTML, SASS and JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNBDYLCk6pc&list=PLMeVVCh-i3Cr3SjCHitrx4dhWkvOIP5Ez)

The video is basic HTML with SASS, working on converting this to React.  Good practice to learn more SASS.
